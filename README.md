## Introduction

This is a collection of random (hopefully useful) code I wrote during my THETA project in BCFN, in the year of 2017.

The name of the package comes from my partner in the project, Agata Jakimowicz. We were trying to get the trajectory of cells inside the ear of zebrafish, *in vivo*, during the project. Most of the code was generated after our discussions.

## Install

Please execute following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py install
```

## What it could do?

Please see the Jupyter notebooks inside folder `notebooks` for its functions.
